 AI-Based Student Dropout Prediction & Retention System:

This project is a web-based application developed to predict the dropout risk of students using academic and personal factors. In many educational institutions, students face issues such as low attendance, academic stress, poor performance, or financial difficulties. These problems are often identified too late.

The aim of this project is to detect such risks at an early stage and provide meaningful feedback so that timely support and guidance can be given to students.

 Project Overview:

The system uses Machine Learning techniques to analyze student data and predict the probability of dropout. Based on the prediction, students are categorized into low, medium, or high risk levels. The project also includes an Explainable AI component that shows which factors influence the prediction the most.

The application is implemented as a user-friendly web dashboard using Streamlit.

 Key Features:

- Predicts student dropout probability  
- Classifies students into LOW, MEDIUM, and HIGH risk categories  
- Uses Machine Learning instead of fixed rules  
- Provides Explainable AI using feature importance graphs  
- Generates clear feedback and intervention suggestions  
- Simple and professional web interface  

---

 Technologies Used:

- Python  
- Streamlit (Web application framework)  
- Pandas and NumPy (Data processing)  
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Matplotlib (Graphs and visualization)

Input Parameters:

The following student details are used as input:

- Attendance percentage  
- Current GPA  
- Internal assessment marks  
- Study hours per week  
- Stress level (scale of 1–10)  
- Financial issues (Yes / No)  

These parameters are commonly used to assess student academic performance and well-being.

How the System Works:

1. Student details are entered through the web interface  
2. The data is processed and passed to the trained machine learning model  
3. The model predicts the dropout probability  
4. Students are categorized into risk levels  
5. Explainable AI highlights important contributing factors  
6. The system provides feedback and improvement suggestions
